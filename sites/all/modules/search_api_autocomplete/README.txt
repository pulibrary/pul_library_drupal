Search API autocomplete
-----------------------

Adds autocomplete capabilities for Search API searches.


Information for users
---------------------

- Necessary server feature

The server on which the search will be executed has to support the
"search_api_autocomplete" feature in order for autocompletion to work. Searches
on other servers won't be affected by this module.
Currently, only the Solr service class [1] is known to support this feature.

- Supported searches

Currently, only search forms built by search pages or search views are
supported directly. However, other modules can easily also use this
functionality. See the "Information for developers" for details.


Information for developers

- Supporting autocompletion with a service class

To support autocompletion with a service class, the class has to support the
"search_api_autocomplete" feature. This will necessitate the service class to
have a getAutocompleteSuggestions() method as detailled in the interface in
search_api_autocomplete.interface.php.

- Supporting autocompletion on a search form

If you have a search form not generated by the Search views or Search pages
modules, you can use hook_search_api_autocomplete_types() to tell this module
about it. For details, see the hook documentation in the
search_api_autocomplete.api.php file, or look at the existing implementations
in search_api_autocomplete.search_api_page.inc and
search_api_autocomplete.search_api_views.inc.
