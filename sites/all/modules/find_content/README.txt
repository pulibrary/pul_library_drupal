Content Search provides a simple way for users to find site content.
Now you can quickly find content as an editor. Rather than scrolling through
pages of content, simply search by title.


HOW TO USE IT
======================
Simply enable the module and head to the Find Content screen.
You'll see the search box there, it's that easy!
