INTRODUCTION
------------

The Entity module enables the user to create front-end forms (fieldable
entities), which contain fields that can be defined. These forms use the
standard Drupal fields. This means that out of the box, the user can use any
standard Drupal node field.

For more information on adding fields visit the Field UI documentation here:
http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/field-ui

RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

The Entityform module was written to specifically take advantage of Drupal's

Entityform integrates:

 * Date - https://www.drupal.org/project/date
 * IMCE - https://www.drupal.org/project/imce
 * Token - https://www.drupal.org/project/token
 * Wysiswyg - https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg
 * Views - https://www.drupal.org/project/views
 * Views Data Export: For downloading submissions -
   https://www.drupal.org/project/views_data_export
 * Features (Entityforms are exportable) -
   https://www.drupal.org/project/features
 * Rules: To react to Entityform submissions -
   https://www.drupal.org/project/rules
 * Entity Reference: For embedding Entityforms in nodes and other entities and
   allows the user to reference other Entities in field submissions -
   https://www.drupal.org/project/entityreference
