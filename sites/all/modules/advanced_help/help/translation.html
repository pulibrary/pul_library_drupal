<p>To translate advanced help, first create a
directory <code>translations/help/<em>language</em></code> in the
module directory. Then, copy the .ini file and all the .html files
from the help directory into this.  If you need to alter an image to
use it in a translation, you also put the altered image there.</p>

<p>The .ini file only needs to keep the titles, and if there is
a <code>name</code> or <code>index name</code> setting in the
'advanced help settings' portion, that should be retained. Any
retained settings should be translated. The rest of the data in the
.ini file may be discarded or ignored.</p>

<p>Each file should then be translated in place.</p>

<p>When translating a .html file, you will find that
the <code>&amp;path&amp;</code> keyword will lead to the original
directory. If you must translate items that are linked, such as images
containing text, use <code>&amp;trans_path&amp;</code> instead, which
will lead to the translated directory. This will allow you to pick and
choose which linked items, if any, will be translated.</p>
